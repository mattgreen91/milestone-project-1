# Milestone Project 1 - Ed Sheeran - by Matt Green

My first project was to create a Static Front-End website.  

I have chosen to design a website for Ed Sheeran fans, which displays information about him, some songs and videos, a link to book tickets to his events,
links to his social media accounts, and a contact form to ask any questions and subscribe to newsletters.  

 _**You can access the completed website by [clicking here](https://mattgreen91.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html) :rocket:**_

The website was created using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4 Framework, and CDN Libraries.

The website has been designed to be fully functional on all devices, including a drop-down mobile navigation menu for small devices.

## 1. UX - User Experience 
 
The Website is predominantly designed for Ed Sheeran Fans.  They are able to listen to his songs and watch his music videos.  They are also able to book tickets for events for his future events, and to subscribe to notifications and newsletters.  They also have links to all his social media accounts. 

The Website is also for those wishing to learn more about Ed Sheeran.  They are able to read information about his family/career history.  They are also able to send a message to find out more information.

**User Stories**

- As a user, I want the website layout to be clear and concise.
- As a user, I want the colours to be appealing but also easy on the eye.
- As a user, I want the navigation to be easy to use, and for me not to get lost in the website.
- As a user, I want all the links to work correctly, and if external - to open in new windows, so I do not get lost.
- As a user, I want some animation to make the website more appealing.
- As a user, I don't want too much text to scroll through.
- As a user, I want all the information to be easy to find.
- As a user, I want all the images to be clear, not pixelised.
- As a user, I want all the sounds and videos to work correctly, and play the correct media source.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to contact, with the option of subscribing.
- As a user, I want the content to adjust automatically when using multiple screen sizes and devices
- As a user, I want some animation so the page is appealing.

**Design**

This project was designed with Balsamiq Wireframes, which can be seen below:

<img src="assets/readme-files/homepage.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

<img src="assets/readme-files/pages2-3.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

This project was created with BootStrap Grid System.  Initially coloured cells were used as a guideline to place information in the correct place, as per the WireFrames.

<img src="assets/readme-files/design-bootstrap-3.png" width="800" style="margin: 0;">

**Accessibility**

The project has many features such as:

* Fall-back fonts, in case Google Fonts are not compatible with the browser
* Alternate Text' attributes for images, in case the images do not display
* Fall-back messages in the iFrames, in case the iFrames are not compatible with the browser
* 'ARIA Hidden' attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), and 'Screen-Reader Only' attributes to make it easier for Screen Readers
* @media Queries, to modify content to fit different sized screens

## 2. Features

The main features of this project are:
 
### Existing Features
- Simplistic Colour Design (black/white/grey) - allows users to see and process information more easily, as the colours are much more appealing to the eye.
- BootStrap Grid System - allows users to view content across multiple sized devices.
- Stylish Font Theme - allows users to feel more engaged by matching similar fonts to Ed Sheeran's writing style.
- Navigation Menu - allows users switch between pages and open Official Ticket Booking Website. Hover animations and Font Awesome icons to add style.
- Mobile Navigation Menu - allows users to save screen space on Mobile Devices by using an animated dropdown menu, so users can see more content.
- Photo Carousel - allows users to view all photos by clicking navigation arrows to make easier, instead of scrolling, but also to add some style.
- Social Media icons - allows users to open Official Social Media accounts in new windows, with hover animations and Font Awesome icons to add style.
- Embedded Spotify tracks - allows users to listen to previews of his soundtracks directly from Spotify, without having to leave the page.
- Embedded YouTube videos - allows users to watch some of his music videos directly from YouTube, without having to leave the page.
- Responsive Contact Form - allows users to send a message with the option of subscribing to newsletters and future event information.

### Features Left to Implement
- The submit button needs to be linked to PHP or SQL severs to work correctly.
- The 'Mobile Navigation Menu' would look nicer in black, but couldn't find this option in BootStrap.

## 4. Testing

This website has been fully tested and is working correctly.  There were some bugs that I had overcome, which you can see by [clicking here](assets/readme-files/issues-experienced.pdf).

I used the Google Chrome and Mozilla FireFox developer tools to tweak code when testing.

<img src="assets/readme-files/testing-1.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

<img src="assets/readme-files/testing-2.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

With the advice of my mentor, I downloaded the Google Chrome Extension `Responsive Viewer` which allowed the content to be viewed across multiple devices at the same time, for optimum performance.

<img src="assets/readme-files/testing-3.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

The HTML5 Code was put through the official validator, which currently has no errors.

<img src="assets/readme-files/html5-validator.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

The CSS3 Code was put through the official validator, which currently has no errors.

## 5. Deployment

This project was created using GitPod IDE which was recommended by Code Institute.  The reason for choosing this IDE is because it is all online, so no additional software needs to be installed, and the project can be accessed and edited on any workstation, as long as internet is available.

Code Institute had provided an Initial Template which included all the relevent extensions to aid with my project. The template can be accessed by [clicking here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

For ease, I downloaded the GitPod [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en) and [Mozilla Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/).  By doing this, a green Gitpod button appears on the project's GitHub page - linking the project directly to the workspace.

The CLI (Command Line Interface) is built into GitPod, which means no additional software needs to be downloaded.

The process for adding/modifying/removing content is as per below:

`git add "file-name-1.ext"` _to add the first new/modified file to the staging area_

`git add "file-name-2.ext"` _to add the second new/modified file to the staging area_

Once all files have been added/updated then...

`git commit -m "commit message goes here"` _the commit message needs to be entered inside the inverted commmas " "_

`git push` _this commmand push the content into the GitHub repository_


When there are multiple files, it can take a long time to add all modifications, so instead I used a shortcut:

`git status`  _to view all status changes_

`all modifications will now be listed here on the CLI`

`git add .`  _the . means 'all above', so this command will update all changes_

`git commit -m "commit message goes here"`  _commit message needs to be entered inside the inverted commas " "_

`git push`  _this commmand push the content into the GitHub repository_


Code Institute also provided a [Readme Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) which I used as a guideline for creating this Readme file.

The project can be opened by [clicking here](https://mattgreen91.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html)
